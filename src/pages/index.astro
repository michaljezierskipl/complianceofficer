        <h3>Governance in Listed Companies</h3>
        <p>
          Working within the framework of a publicly listed organisation: disclosure obligations, good practice codes, relations with supervisory boards and audit committees, and alignment with internal audit and finance functions.
        </p>

        <h3>New Technologies &amp; Emerging Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding how technologies — including data-driven tools and AI — reshape regulatory and operational risks. Focusing on practical governance, clear accountability and realistic controls.
