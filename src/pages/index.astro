        <p>
          Designing, implementing and supervising compliance frameworks at group level: policies, procedures, training, investigations, monitoring and reporting. Ensuring that compliance supports the business instead of acting as a barrier.

          Building and maintaining enterprise risk management systems for diverse, multi-entity organisations. Integrating risk assessments with strategic planning and board-level decision making.

        <h3>Governance in Listed Companies</h3>
        <p>
          Working within the framework of a publicly listed organisation: disclosure obligations, good practice codes, relations with supervisory boards and audit committees, and alignment with internal audit and finance functions.
        </p>

        <h3>New Technologies &amp; Emerging Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding how technologies — including data-driven tools and AI — reshape regulatory and operational risks. Focusing on practical governance, clear accountability and realistic controls.

      <!-- CURRENT ROLE -->
      <section>
        <h2>Current role</h2>
        <p>
          I currently serve as Director of Compliance and Risk Management at
          <strong>Grupa Kęty S.A.</strong>, a major industrial group listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          My responsibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>designing and supervising compliance and risk processes across the capital group,</li>
          <li>advising the management board on key compliance and risk matters,</li>
          <li>preparing analyses and information for the supervisory board and its committees,</li>
          <li>coordinating with internal audit and other control functions,</li>
          <li>ensuring alignment between compliance, governance and strategic goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My role combines regulatory depth with pragmatic business understanding — helping the organisation operate confidently in a demanding market and regulatory environment.

      <!-- INTERNATIONAL / GCC / UAE FOCUS -->
      <section>
        <h2>International &amp; GCC / UAE focus</h2>
        <p>
          While my base is in Poland, my professional interests and profile are international.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am open to senior compliance and risk roles — as well as advisory engagements — in the EU and GCC region (including the UAE), particularly in organisations that need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>build or strengthen compliance frameworks from the ground up,</li>
          <li>establish enterprise risk management systems in growing groups,</li>
          <li>align governance, compliance and risk functions to meet rising regulatory and stakeholder expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I bring experience from a large, listed industrial group where compliance and risk have to support growth, not merely limit it.
        </p>
